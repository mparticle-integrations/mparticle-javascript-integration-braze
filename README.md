# Notice! Opt in is now available for Braze Web SDK V4 - Action Required

You can now select what version of the Braze SDK you want to use when setting up a Braze connection in the mParticle UI.  Braze occasionally makes breaking changes to their SDK, so if you call `appboy` directly in your code, you will have to update your code to ensure your website performs as expected when updating versions of Braze.

Please review the [Braze Changelog](https://www.braze.com/docs/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/web/changelog#400) and [V4 migration guide](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-web-sdk/blob/master/UPGRADE_GUIDE.md) to learn about the differences between V3 and V4 and what changes you will need to make in your code. The most significant breaking changes are the replacement of the `appboy` class name with `braze`, in addition to the removal and renaming of several APIs.

You can opt into the latest major version of the Braze Web SDK whether you implement mParticle's Web SDK using npm or our snippet/CDN.
* Customers who self-host mParticle via npm - You can use @mparticle/web-braze-kit version 4.0.0 in your package.json now! This has been available since 10/15/2022.
* Customers who load mParticle via snippet/CDN - Opting in is available via the mParticle UI in your Braze connection settings.

Note that the following is only one example.  Everywhere you manually call `appboy` needs to be updated similar to the below. If you are using NPM, you can skip to step 3.  Please be sure to test your site fully in development prior to releasing.


* Step 1: Legacy code sample. Find all the places where your code references the `appboy.display` namespace.  Braze has removed all instances of the `display` namespace:
```javascript
window.appboy.display.destroyFeed();
```

Step 2: Roll out code changes prior to optin in to V4
```javascript
if (window.appboy) {
	window.appboy.display.destroyFeed();
} else if (window.braze) {
	window.braze.destroyFeed();
}
```
Step 3: Opt into Version 4.  Simply navigate to your connection settings and selection `Version 4` from the new Braze Web SDK Version drop down.  

Step 4: After you opt in, you can simplify your code. We recommend testing and waiting at least 24 hours between opting in and removing previous instances of `appboy` and doing thorough testing of your application in a development environment to ensure everything is working:
```javascript
window.braze.destroyFeed();
```

Step 5: Push Notifications via service-worker.js
If you use Push Notifications, we have updated the `service-worker.js` file.  In our testing, Braze’s push notifications work as expected regardless of what version of the service-worker is used, but we recommend updating this file to ensure future compatibility.  In your `service-worker.js` file, update the code to reference `https://static.mparticle.com/sdk/js/braze/service-worker-4.2.0.js` instead of `https://static.mparticle.com/sdk/js/braze/service-worker-3.5.0.js`.  Your `service-worker.js` file should now contain:

```javascript
self.imports('https://static.mparticle.com/sdk/js/braze/service-worker-4.2.0.js')
```

### Transition from @mparticle/web-appboy-kit to @mparticle/web-braze-kit

The legacy @mparticle/web-appboy-kit from npm includes version 2 of the Braze Web SDK.  As part of this update, we've created a new [Braze web kit repo](https://github.com/mparticle-integrations/mparticle-javascript-integration-braze) to replace our deprecated [Appboy web kit repo](https://github.com/mparticle-integrations/mparticle-javascript-integration-appboy).  If you are still using `@mparticle/web-appboy-kit`, you will need to consider the breaking changes Braze made between V2 and V3 of the Braze SDK (found [here](https://www.braze.com/docs/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/web/changelog/#300)) as well as the instructions above to get from V2 to V4 of the Braze SDK.
